I thought that even if you help everyone,
even if you make everyone happy,
even if everyone falls in love...
You will still be alone.
I thought that they hate us because we are satori.
And yet...\nYou have found someone who loves you, onee-chan.
Then it's a problem with me, isn't it?
I am the outlier here, because I can't close my third eye.
People hate me, and only me.
But I can fix that.
I can be fixed, right onee-chan?
