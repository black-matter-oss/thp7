I thought that even if you help everyone, even if you make everyone happy, even if everyone falls in love, you will still be alone.
I thought that they hate us because we are satori.
And yet... You have found someone who loves you, onee-chan.
That must mean... that it's a problem with me, isn't it?
I am the outlier here, because I can't close my third eye.
People hate me, and only me.
But there's a simple solution to this, is there not, onee-chan?
