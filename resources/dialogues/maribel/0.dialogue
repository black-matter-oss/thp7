Satori Komeiji: [#e=neutral] ...
Satori Komeiji: [#e=neutral] If you're scared of me, then why did you come here?
Maribel Hearn: [#e=neutral] I needed to, I suppose.
Maribel Hearn: [#e=neutral] It'll be fine, as long as you don't try to read my mind.
Satori Komeiji: [#e=neutral] Oh, then you'll be [i]pleased[/i] to hear that my [i]moral compass[/i] [b]very strictly[/b] prohibits the use of my third eye without consent.
Maribel Hearn: [#e=annoyed] Very well then.
